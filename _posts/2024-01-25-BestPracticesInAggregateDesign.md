Domain-Driven Design (DDD) revolves around accurately modeling the domain to solve business problems effectively. One of the key building blocks in DDD is the Aggregate. In this post, we'll explore best practices in designing Aggregates, with practical examples to illustrate these concepts.

## What is an Aggregate?

An Aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes. Each Aggregate has an Aggregate Root, which is the only member of the Aggregate that outside objects are allowed to hold references to.

## Best Practices in Aggregate Design

### 1. Keep Aggregates Small

Aggregates should be designed to be as small as possible. Large Aggregates can lead to complex transactional scenarios and performance issues.

### 2. Design Around Business Transactions

An Aggregate should encapsulate all the data and behavior required to perform a specific business transaction.

### 3. Reference Other Aggregates by Identity

Aggregates should reference other Aggregates only by their identifier, not by holding a direct object reference.

### 4. Protect Business Invariants

The Aggregate Root should ensure the consistency of changes to data within the Aggregate and protect business rules.

### 5. Favor Eventual Consistency Outside the Aggregate Boundary

When consistency across Aggregates is required, prefer eventual consistency over immediate consistency to maintain Aggregate autonomy.

## Practical Example: Online Shopping System

Consider an online shopping system with `Order` and `Product` entities.

### Example Scenario

In our scenario, an `Order` can have multiple `OrderLines`, each referencing a `Product`. 

### Class Design

Hereâ€™s how we might design these classes:
![bestAggregate image]({{ "/assets/image/bestAggregate.png" | relative_url }})

### Aggregate Rules

Order is the Aggregate Root.
OrderLine is part of the Order Aggregate and references Product by ID.
Business rules, such as order total calculation, are enforced within the Order Aggregate.

### Conclusion

Effective Aggregate design is crucial in implementing Domain-Driven Design. It helps in maintaining the consistency of business rules and simplifying complex domain models.
